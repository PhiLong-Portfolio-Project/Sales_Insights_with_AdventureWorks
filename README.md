# Sales Analysis and Insight with AdventureWorks

### About AdventureWorksDW Database
The AdventureWorksDW database is a comprehensive, widely-used sample database developed by Microsoft to showcase the capabilities of SQL Server and related technologies. It simulates a fictional company named AdventureWorks Cycles, which specializes in manufacturing and selling bicycles and related accessories. AdventureWorksDW is a data warehouse database that contains a wealth of information structured to support business intelligence, reporting, and data analysis scenarios. 

### About my project
In this project, I used SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Power BI for visualization, I aimed to uncover key business insights and trends that can drive strategic decision-making.

The analysis focused on three core aspects:

- **Sales Overview:** Detailed examination of sales performance across various dimensions such as time, geography, and sales channels, providing a clear picture of revenue trends and growth opportunities.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identification and categorization of customer segments based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant criteria to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Product Details:** In-depth analysis of product performance, including bestsellers, inventory levels, and profitability, enabling more informed product management and development decisions.
