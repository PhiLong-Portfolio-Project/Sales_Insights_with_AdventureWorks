### About Database
The AdventureWorksDW database is a comprehensive, widely-used sample database developed by Microsoft to showcase the capabilities of SQL Server and related technologies. It simulates a fictional company named AdventureWorks Cycles, which specializes in manufacturing and selling bicycles and related accessories. AdventureWorksDW is a data warehouse database that contains a wealth of information structured to support business intelligence, reporting, and data analysis scenarios.
